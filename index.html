                  Early Years and Struggles
               </h2>
               <p>
                  Some of my most vivid memories from my school years come from hanging out and playing games with friends. Neither my friends or I were very good at sports, yet we all
                  craved competition. From the start we found fighting games. The most poignant memory being my best friends and I playing Blaz Blue Centralfiction in our friend's basement.
                  We kept up until sunrise practicing and grinding away at what felt like a Sisyphean task. It was not meaningless though, it helped unlock this hunger, this drive that 
                  has not stopped burning. I can never forget that feeling. The absolute drive for competition, the epic highs and devastating lows competing against one another. Nothing
                  could ever compare. I lost this drive 4 years ago.
                  <br>
                  After that night, I kept practicing. I kept getting better, yet my friends fell out of it. Life got busy, college was coming up, and COVID-19 happened. I then fell out
                  of practice. I worked one of the worst summers of my life in 2020. I graduated, yet I still did not get an actual graduation. I was stressed and overworked, never giving
                  myself a proper break. All my plans uprooted, no agency in any of this. I went to college, and I burnt myself out. I destroyed my mental health trying to maintain a dream
                  that I never could define. I move back home and for the next 3 years recover. <i>Finally back with all my old friends.</i> we start playing fighting games again.

                  In May of 2024, schedules aligned and I could finally play fighitng games with my friends, in person, yet again. Yet some problems persisted from my child self. 
                  I was angry. I got angry when I lost, I thought I stomped out that side of me a long time ago. But yet, anger still rears its' ugly head. I could feel that greed,
                  that hunger for the win. But to make up for my lack of practice, an unhealthy side of me came out and I had to not let it fester. My friends saw this and helped me,
                  I got tips, I got actual encouragement. It was genuinely what saved me from walking that constant anger path. I now can play and win or lose and stay level headed,
                  with the help of my friends I can do this. currently we now hold a weekly sort of tournament to get better, and we are hoping to actually attend real fighting game 
                  tournaments. I am improving, I am succeeding, and <a>I love it.</a>

                  While it is the game I enjoy the least, I still enjoy it. Injustice 2 is a wierd game. It has insane balencing issues, with certain stages enabling
                  enabling infinite combos. Still it is a game that is close to my heart as one I played with many friends. It was always such a blast seeing some of
                  your favorite superheroes and villians duking it out. I will never forget how much fun I had playing this game, and how much it made me enjoy 
                  playing characters like Supergirl, Superman, and Green Lantern.

                  Blazblue on the other hand is one of my favorite games of all time. No matter how much I get dumpstered on in this game, it is almost always fun. it plays silky smooth with
                  little to no issues. This game means so much to me. From that earlier fighting game bootcamp I mentioned earlier, to hanging with friends and running sets now. This game
                  mad mw grow closer to my friends, and inspire that competition in our hearts. Even today the guys I started playing with, are now some of my closest friends. 
                  all it took was a good game and some frienldy competition.

                  Guilty Gear Strive is my favorite fighting game, no contest. My friends and I started weekly tournaments at almost the same time as the start of this program. It has 
                  slowly improved my motivation. Guilty Gear reignited me. This game has made me take a deep look at myself, and made me change. I have changed, I have changed for the 
                  better not because of the game, but my friends and the people around me encouraging me. I like the person I am now, and I have Guilty Gear and my friends to thank.
